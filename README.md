# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge Repo

The final submission file is titled "Crypto_Clustering_Final.ipynb." I kept my working file as well as the source starter code in the repository for reference.

The questions for the challenge are answered within the notebook.

I accessed the AI learning assistant to learn how to combine two graphs side by side using the "*" symbol. 

I also received the import warnings/supress FutureWarning code snippet at the beginning of the notebook from our instructor.
